Yes, you can regain access to Jenkins even if you've lost it due to incorrect Role-Based Authorization Strategy settings. Follow one of these methods to restore admin access:

Method 1: Disable Security Temporarily
This method disables security so you can log in and fix the settings.

Steps:
Stop Jenkins Service

Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
c
Copy
Edit
net stop jenkins
Or stop the Jenkins service from Services (services.msc).
Edit Config File (config.xml)

Go to the Jenkins home directory (default: C:\ProgramData\Jenkins or C:\Users\your-user\.jenkins).
Open config.xml in a text editor.
Find the line:
xml
Copy
Edit
<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>
Change it to:
xml
Copy
Edit
<useSecurity>false</useSecurity>
Save and close the file.
Restart Jenkins

Run:
c
Copy
Edit
net start jenkins
Or start the Jenkins service from Services.
Log in Without Authentication

Open Jenkins in a browser (http://localhost:8080).
Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security.
Fix role-based authorization settings or re-add your user.
Re-enable Security

Edit config.xml again and set <useSecurity>true</useSecurity>.
Restart Jenkins.
Method 2: Create a New Admin User Using Groovy Script
If you can access Jenkins script console (or use CLI), you can create a new admin user.

Steps:
Access Jenkins Script Console

Open http://localhost:8080/script (if you still have access).
If access is lost, follow Method 1 first, then try this.
Run the Groovy Script Below Copy and paste the following script:

groovy
Copy
Edit
import jenkins.model.*
import hudson.security.*

def instance = Jenkins.getInstance()
def hudsonRealm = new HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm(false)
hudsonRealm.createAccount("admin", "admin123")
instance.setSecurityRealm(hudsonRealm)

def strategy = new FullControlOnceLoggedInAuthorizationStrategy()
instance.setAuthorizationStrategy(strategy)
instance.save()

println("Admin user created: Username: admin, Password: admin123")
Click Run.
Log in with:
makefile
Copy
Edit
Username: admin
Password: admin123
Reconfigure Security

Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security.
Fix role-based access and re-add your user.
Method 3: Reset the Authorization Strategy
If role-based access is misconfigured, reset it by modifying config.xml.

Steps:
Stop Jenkins (net stop jenkins).
Edit config.xml in Jenkins home directory.
Find the following block:
xml
Copy
Edit
<authorizationStrategy class="org.jenkinsci.plugins.rolebasedstrategy.RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy">
Replace it with:
xml
Copy
Edit
<authorizationStrategy class="hudson.security.FullControlOnceLoggedInAuthorizationStrategy"/>
Restart Jenkins (net start jenkins).
Log in and fix role-based settings.
